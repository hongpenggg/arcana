## 🔮 About Tarot

Tarot is a tool for storytelling, reflection, and intuition. It consists of 78 cards divided into:

- **Major Arcana (22 cards)**: Life's karmic and spiritual lessons
- **Minor Arcana (56 cards)**: Daily trials and tribulations
  - Cups (emotions)
  - Swords (intellect)
  - Wands (passion)
  - Pentacles (material world)

Tarot is not about predicting the future, but rather reflecting on the present to make better choices for your path ahead.
